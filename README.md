Send PGP encrypted emails on the commandline with Gmail

## Oauth and Google API
This script uses **oauth** to authenticate against your Gmail account, and then uses the [Google API](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/reference/rest "Gmail API Reference") to connect to your Gmail inbox. In order to use or modify this script, you should have a basic understanding of how oauth works.

If you want to use **SMTP with TLS** and authenticate with your username and password instead, you need to allow this kind of access in your Gmail settings. Google considers this as insecure, as you usually store your username/password somewhere within the app or script, and can't use 2FA or solve captchas for access protection.

Oauth is a common standard for logging in to one internet service using a different existing account from somewhere else. You have probably already used oauth to login to a new website by using your Google, Facebook, Twitter or GitHub account. Here is a link where you can check which **apps or websites you already granted authentication access** to your Google account:
